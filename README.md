The React code for creating a resume page using the Input-Process-Output (IPO) model works as follows:

1. Input:  
   In React, the input is handled by Resume.js which is a file containing structure (HTML/JSX) of resume. The name and education level, skills and work experience of a user are also displayed coded as static content. These aspects can be real-time, or even passed through props, API calls, or user inputs in real-world practice.

2. Process:  
   By so doing, the Resume.css file handles the aspect of how the content is to be displayed. They use styles such as background color of `rgba(#bdfb04)`, text alignment and font to make the resume look well formatted and professional. The React component analyses the data by translating the structure of the page into an interactive webpage.

3. Output:  
   This means the styled and formatted resume appears as a webpage. The rendering mechanism of React makes sure that the content is refreshed in case the data or styles it represents are altered.

It provides modularity of concerns; where content (Resume.js) is pulled separately from styling (Resume.css) as well as rendering via React.
