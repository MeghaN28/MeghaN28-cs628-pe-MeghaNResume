Input  
The program receives as input a fixed array of movie objects which are defined in advance. Each object contains three attributes: title, genre, and releaseYear as the properties of movies. The user inputs the data through a dropdown, to select a genre of the movie, and then, to select a movie, they click on a movie card, which will appear on the screen, and its title will be displayed in an alert box. This interaction can be characterized as dynamic user inputs to change the programâ€™s behavior.  

 Process  
In a manner that is equally significant, the program transforms the input in two important ways. First, it employs the usage of the useState hook to store the selected genre and then applies the filter function where it checks for a match on the genre. Second, it waits for click event on movie cards and shows an alert with the title of the clicked movie. The movie filtering logic involves the use of the filter method in JavaScript that automatically updates the list of movies to be displayed depending on the selected genre.  

Output  
The output is a list of movies as individual cards, styled with visual elements. When filtered, only movies, which belong to the selected genre, can be seen. Furthermore, the click on a movie prints a message with the title of this movie, which makes it possible to get an interesting interaction.
